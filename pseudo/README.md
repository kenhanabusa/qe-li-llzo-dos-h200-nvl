# Pseudopotentials

This directory should contain the UPF files needed to run the examples.

We do NOT redistribute the UPF files in this repository due to licensing.
Please download the required pseudopotentials (PBE-based Li/La/Zr/O, etc.)
from the official Quantum ESPRESSO / PSLibrary collections and place them
here before running the calculations.
